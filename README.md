# Graphics

Assesment on graphics programming and physics combined.

Not particularily impressive.
Uses open gl to render 3D models.
Custom physics that allows attaching of rigidbodies and colliders with different values.

Needs some cleaning up as it doesn't like having both 3D and 2D becuase of how the circles are made.
